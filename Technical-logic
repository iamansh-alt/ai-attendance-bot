🧠Technical Logic Flow
The system operates on a state-aware logic loop to ensure data integrity and a seamless user experience. Here is how the "brain" of the project functions:

Input Trigger: A Telegram message is received via Webhook.

User Verification: The system identifies the user based on their unique Telegram ID.

State Lookup (Google Sheets): The workflow queries the "Attendance" sheet to find the most recent entry for that specific user.

Intent Processing (Gemini AI):

The user's message and their current status (e.g., "Currently Out") are sent to Gemini.

Gemini determines if the message is a "Check-in" or "Check-out" request.

Conditional Branching:

If User is 'Out' and requests 'Check-in': The system creates a new row with a timestamp.

If User is 'In' and requests 'Check-out': The system updates the existing row with a "Time-out" value.

If Request is Invalid: The AI generates a polite clarification message (e.g., "You are already checked in. Did you mean to check out?").

Response: The bot sends a confirmation back to Telegram, closing the loop
